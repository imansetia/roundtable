# CHANGELOG

One entry per milestone, including deviations from SPEC.md (section 12).

## M1 — Server runs locally, all tools, all acceptance tests pass (2026-11-10)

Built: `roundtable/` server package (config, SQLite board, MCP server),
`tests/test_acceptance.py` (12 tests), `pyproject.toml`, `.env.example`,
`agents.example.json`, README. Verified with the official MCP Python SDK
v2.3.0 over Streamable HTTP on `127.0.0.1`. Test result: **12 passed**.

Deviations / interpretations (spec section 12 requires listing these):

1. **Agents config format is not defined by the spec** (section 4 says only
   "a config file written by the Owner"). Chosen: `agents.json`, an object
   with an `agents` list of `{name, role, skills, token}`. Documented in
   README.md and `agents.example.json`; startup fails fast unless there
   is exactly one leader.
2. **Rate limit counts tool calls only**, not HTTP handshake / `initialize` /
   `list_tools` requests (section 7.3 says "per token", without saying what
   counts). Counting protocol overhead would make the limit depend on the
   client's session behaviour.
3. **`review_note` capped at 4,000 chars** (like a message). The spec caps
   title/description/message/result (section 7.2) but gives no limit for
   review notes; an unbounded field was left open rather than silently
   accepted without bound.
4. **`create_task` rejects an assignee who is the leader.** Only workers
   can claim (section 6), so assigning a task to the leader would create
   a task nobody can claim. Rejected with a clear error instead.
5. **A task created with an `assignee` can only be claimed by that
   worker**; an unassigned task can be claimed by any worker. The spec
   says the assignee is assigned "directly" without defining the claim
   rule; this is the reading that makes direct assignment meaningful.
6. **On reject, the assignee is cleared** when the task returns to `open`,
   so it can be claimed again (by anyone). The spec says only
   "rejected -> open".
7. **No reassign tool.** The state diagram (section 5) mentions "leader
   reassigns" as a claimed -> open path, but section 6 defines no such
   tool, so M1 does not invent one. A leader can cancel a claimed task
   and create a replacement. Open question for the Owner/Auditor — see
   below.
8. **SDK version pinned: `mcp[cli]==2.3.0`.** The spec says to check the
   SDK's current docs rather than rely on remembered APIs; v2 renamed
   `FastMCP` to `MCPServer` and the old import fails. Tool results are
   returned as JSON text (in SDK 2.3.0 a `dict` return serialises to text
   content, not `structured_content`); tests parse the JSON text.

Open questions (for the Owner/Auditor, M1 review):

- Q1: Should there be a leader-only `reassign_task` tool (claimed ->
  open with a new assignee), or is cancel + recreate the intended path?
- Q2: Should the leader be allowed to claim a task directly (e.g. for
  small fixes), or is leader-never-executes the intended model?
- Q3: `list_tasks` returns `total` over all tasks (not filtered count).
  Is a filtered total wanted, or is the current behaviour fine?
- Q4: Should `post_message` be allowed on `done`/`cancelled` tasks, or
  restricted to open/claimed/submitted ones? M1 allows it on any task.
